JASH stands for "Just Another SHell". Through this project, I'm supposed to learn some of the basics of the C language.

### Try JASH

#### Cloning and compilation:
```
git clone github.com/mehedirm6244/jash
cd jash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . 
```

#### Executing JASH:

The binary file is created as `jash/build/jash`. Assuming that your current working directory is `jash/build`, you can execute JASH by typing:
```
./jash
```
